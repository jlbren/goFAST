<p>goFAST is developed by Emma Highland and 
Jon Brenner, both of Loyola University Chicago. This project was developed for the class
"Client-Side Web Development" (COMP 424).</p>
<br /><br />
<p>goFAST is a way for people who are interested in a paper on PMC 
to find Twitter users and tweets that are relevant to the paper.<br />
E.g. if someone finds an interesting paper on bacteriophages in 
freshwater environments, our app would direct them to scientists on Twitter who 
discuss freshwater bacteriophages or tweets about this subject. 
There is a vibrant community of 
scientists on Twitter. We seek to connect academics/students/those who read scientific papers
to the scientists who could help them network with others 
in their field, understand the papers, provide career advice or mentorship, etc.</p>
